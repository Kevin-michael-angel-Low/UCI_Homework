# 02 VBA Homework by Kevin Low

First used the Cells command to set the titles for the two major tables.

Used the End(xlUp) function to find the last row in the data, then looped through the entire table. 

To check for the end of a "set" of tickers, checked if the next cell's ticker does not match the previous cell's ticker.
If so, set that cell as the end date.

Use the start and end dates in the data analysis in table #2. 

Similarly, use for loops to iterate through table #2 to obtain maximum and minimum values.
